\begin{sct}{Research}

\experience{Researcher}{University of California Santa Cruz}{Santa Cruz, CA}%
{Professors Mateas, Wardrip-Fruin, and Jhala}{Fall 2009--Spring 2016}{
Worked with Ben Weber on a \work{Starcraft} AI written in the reactive planning
language ABL. Built a level generator for \work{Infinite Mario} using an
occupancy-based algorithm. Worked with Brandon Tearse to create \work{Skald}, a
rational reconstruction of the \work{Minstrel} story generation system. Worked
on brainstorming and prototyping for a climate science education game with a
team of students, faculty, and external advisors. Collaborated closely with
many faculty on these projects, including Michael Mateas, Noah Wardrip-Fruin,
and Arnav Jhala. My thesis project was \work{Dunyazad}, a system that generates
narrative choices according to a theory of choice poetics.

\experience{Research Assistant}{Harvey Mudd College}{Claremont, CA}%
{Professor Dodds}{Summer 2008}{
Implemented FastSLAM on inexpensive robot platforms using single-camera vision.
}

\experience{Researcher}{Harvey Mudd College}{Claremont, CA}%
{Professor Stone}{Fall 2007--Spring 2008}{
Worked with RealNetworks through the Harvey Mudd College clinic program to
design a distributed streaming algorithm.

\experience{Research Assistant}{Harvey Mudd College}{Claremont, CA}%
{Professor Erlinger}{Summer 2007}{
Deployed a wireless sensor network for collecting microclimate temperature data.

\begin{sct}{Teaching}

\experience{Visiting Professor}{Computer Science Department, Pomona College}{Claremont, CA}%
{Dr. Tzu-Yi Chen}{Fall 2016--Spring 2017}{
I’m currently a visiting professor in the Computer Science department at Pomona
College. I taught CSCI 151 Artificial Intelligence and co-taught CSCI 062 Data
Structures in the fall semester, and I am now teaching CSCI 030 Computation and
Cognition and CSCI 062 Data Structures.
}

\experience{Teaching Assistant}{COSMOS Program, University of California Santa Cruz}{Santa Cruz, CA}%
{Christopher Maraffi}{Summer 2014}{
I was the teaching assistant for an intensive 4-week summer course as part of
the COSMOS program. Exceptional high-school students learned game design and
programming fundamentals, completing two projects over the course and learning
about GameMaker, Processing, Blender, and Unity. I helped students with their
projects and gave a few lectures on game design concepts.

\newpage

\combexp{Teaching Assistant}{University of California Santa Cruz}{Santa Cruz, CA}%
{
CMPS 80K: Foundations of Interactive Game Design, Professor Mateas, \textit{Spring 2014} \vspace{2pt} \\
A large general education class introducing game design concepts. Students used
GameMaker to learn game design fundamentals and made games as their final
projects. As part of a team of TAs and graders, I taught GameMaker in two
weekly sections, while the lectures covered design topics. Most of the grading
was done by undergraduate graders; I directly managed four graders and also
helped maintain the master grade spreadsheet for the entire class.
\vspace{6pt}

CMPS 160: Introduction to Computer Graphics, Professor Davis, \textit{Fall 2013} \vspace{2pt} \\
A core upper-division computer science class covering the basics of computer
graphics. Students completed several well-structured graphics projects as well
as a mid-term and a final. Professor Davis let me help extensively with
homework and test design, and I also taught lab sections and helped students
during office hours.
\vspace{6pt}

CMPS 179: Game Design Practicum, Professor Swanson, \textit{Spring 2013} \vspace{2pt} \\
A small elective class on interactive data visualization. Students learned
Javascript and WebGL, and created websites that visualized data from eBay using
both 2D and 3D techniques. I helped manage assignment submissions and grading,
as well as giving students detailed feedback on their final projects.\vspace{6pt}

\textit{I was given my department's 2011-2012 outstanding TA of the year award.}
\vspace{6pt}

CMPS 172: Game Design Studio III, Professor Whitehead, \textit{Spring 2012} \vspace{2pt} \\
The final quarter of the game design major’s senior capstone class. Along with
another TA, I held weekly progress report meetings with several teams working
to complete their game projects, giving detailed feedback and helping teams
manage their schedules. Helped resolve internal disputes and ensure that team
members were each doing their fair share of the work.
\vspace{6pt}

CMPS 146: Game AI, Professor Mateas, \textit{Spring 2014} \vspace{2pt} \\
A large upper-division elective in which students learned about game AI
techniques such as search and behavior trees. I helped design assignments and
managed submissions and grading, and covered lecture when Professor Mateas was
travelling.
}

\experience{Teaching Assistant}{Harvey Mudd College}{Claremont, CA}%
{CS 124: User Interface Design, Professor Alvarado}{Spring 2009}{
Worked as a grader/tutor for a course on user interface design, giving students
detailed feedback on written assignments and helping them with UI design
projects.
}

\experience{Teaching Assistant}{Harvey Mudd College}{Claremont, CA}%
{CS 5: Introduction to Computer Science, Professors Dodds and Libeskind-Hadas}{Fall 2006}{
Worked as a grader/tutor for the first offering of the new introductory CS
course that I had helped design over the summer (see below).
}

\experience{Course Design Assistant}{Harvey Mudd College}{Claremont, CA}%
{CS 5: Introduction to Computer Science, Professors Dodds and Libeskind-Hadas}{Summer 2006}{
Helped design a new introductory CS course that taught Python and helped build
a website to host course information, assignments, and student submissions.
Also worked on a simple assembly language emulator for use in student
assignments.
